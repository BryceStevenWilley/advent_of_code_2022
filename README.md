# Advent of Code 2022 - Ruby

Completing [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com), while attempting to pick up a bit of ruby.

I treated this as an exercise in becoming "conversational" in a new language through 15-45 minutes dedicated each day.
I wrote a [blog post explaining more about my thought process](https://brycewilley.xyz/2023/02/advent_of_code_in_ruby).


## How to run

`ruby dayX.rb`

Advent of codes requests that people don't publish problem inputs, even though all inputs differ by user. Most of the
scripts assume that each day's input is in the repo, as `dayX.txt`. I tried to not have lots of shared code between solution, since I didn't want to refactor older days.
