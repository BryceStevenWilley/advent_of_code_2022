# Advent of Code 2022 - Ruby

Completing [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com), while attempting to pick up a bit of ruby.

I know no ruby, please don't judge me.


## How to run

`ruby dayX.rb`

All inputs (which apparently differ by user) are saved as `dayX.txt`, also in the top level dir. Trying not to share a lot of code, because I don't want to have to refactor older days.
